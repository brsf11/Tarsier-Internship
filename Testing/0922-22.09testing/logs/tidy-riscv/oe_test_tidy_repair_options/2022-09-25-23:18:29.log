You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and
properties such as its size and color. This will reduce
the size of HTML files and make them easier to maintain
compared with using <FONT> elements.

URIs must be properly escaped, they must not contain unescaped
characters below U+0021 including the space character and not
above U+007E. Tidy escapes the URI for you as recommended by
HTML 4.01 section B.2.1 and XML 1.0 section 4.2.2. Some user agents
use another algorithm to escape such URIs and some server-sided
scripts depend on that. If you want to depend on that, you must
escape the URI on your own. For more information please refer to
http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html
